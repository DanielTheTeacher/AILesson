            <ListItem><strong>Personalization:</strong> AI algorithms tailor content (feeds, recommendations, notifications) to be as engaging as possible for you.</ListItem>
            <ListItem><strong>Engagement Optimization:</strong> AI can identify and promote content that captures attention (e.g., emotional, sensational), regardless of quality or accuracy.</ListItem>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-slate-700 mb-2 leading-relaxed">
            Once your attention is captured, you become more susceptible to manipulation. Misinformation and disinformation can more easily take root when you're already engaged and perhaps less critical. Your values can also be subtly shaped. For example, you might see a "cringe" video of a woman with brightly colored hair who is vegan and says something outrageous. Even if the video is designed purely to provoke anger and get views (thereby making money for the creator), repeated exposure to such content could unconsciously affect your attitude towards people with colored hair, vegans, or people holding certain political opinions. The goal of such content is often just to make you react, not to inform or engage in good faith.

            Disadvantages can include increased distraction, impact on mental health, and spread of misleading content. For you as a vocational student in <strong className="text-sky-600">{selectedVocation}</strong>, it's important to protect your focus for learning and future work.
