        <p className="text-slate-700 mb-2 leading-relaxed">
          Think of AI as computers or programs that can do things that usually require human intelligence. This can be learning from experience, solving problems, making decisions, or understanding language.

        <p className="text-slate-700 mb-2 leading-relaxed">
          An important part of AI is <Tooltip text="Systems that learn from large amounts of data to find patterns and make decisions without being specifically programmed for each task.">Machine Learning (ML)</Tooltip>. For example, streaming services use Machine Learning (ML) to suggest movies.<CitationLink referenceId="ref-1" text="[1]" />
