    <!-- Application Structure Plan: 
        The SPA is structured with a fixed top navigation bar allowing users to jump to different thematic sections within the single page. This approach enhances usability by providing a clear overview and easy access to all content areas. The themes are derived from the report's modules but reorganized for a more intuitive user flow:
        1. Home: Introduction and overview.
        2. Explore AI: Covers the basics of AI, its presence in daily life, and relevance to vocational fields. "AI Around Us" is now a reflective prompt. Illustrative chart removed. Citations modified for subtlety.
        3. Think Critically: Addresses AI bias (updated examples), hallucinations (explanation enhanced), misinformation, and filter bubbles. "Burst the Bubble" exercise enhanced for more interaction (reflection prompts, action plan without simulated submission). Citations modified for subtlety.
        4. AI as Helper: Focuses on responsible AI use, the "You First" principle (significantly expanded with metaphors and cognitive development discussion), augmentation vs. generation, ethical use cases (AI Project Idea Expander removed), and academic integrity (Norwegian plagiarism rules integrated). Citations modified for subtlety.
        5. Your Future with AI: Explores AI's impact on jobs and highlights essential human skills. "My Vocational Future with AI" is now a reflective writing prompt. Citations modified for subtlety.
        6. AI & Society: Discusses data privacy, ethical dilemmas, and the student's role in shaping AI. "Create an AI Ethics Charter" is now a reflective/discussion prompt. Citations modified for subtlety.
        7. Exercises: A quick access point to key interactive elements from various sections.
        8. References: New section added for all cited sources, now collapsible and styled for subtlety.
        This thematic, non-linear structure is chosen over a direct module-by-module translation to make the content more engaging and allow students to explore topics based on interest, facilitating better understanding and retention for the target audience (VG1 vocational students). Key interactions include quizzes, reflective inputs, and clickable reveals. Gemini API features removed and converted to reflective prompts.

                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Think of AI as computers or programs that can do things that usually require human intelligence. This can be learning from experience, solving problems, making decisions, or understanding language.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    An important part of AI is <span class="tooltip">Machine Learning (ML)<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup><span class="tooltiptext">Systems that learn from large amounts of data to find patterns and make decisions without being specifically programmed for each task.</span></span>. For example, streaming services use ML to suggest movies you might like.

They learn patterns in language and can generate text, answer questions, and much more.

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside content-text mb-2 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Dangerous "Facts" for Your Trade:</strong> Imagine you're an Elektro-student looking up safety rules for high-voltage installations. An AI might give you an answer in perfect Norwegian, claiming these are "Norwegian electrical safety standards." But, if the AI was mostly trained on American data, it might actually be giving you US electrical codes, just translated. Following these could be extremely dangerous in Norway, as safety standards differ, potentially leading to accidents, equipment damage, or even electrocution. The AI *sounds* correct, but it's dangerously wrong for your specific location and rules. (Illustrative example based on principles from <sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[21, 22]</a></sup>)</li>
                    <li><strong>Getting Skipped for an Opportunity (And No One Knows Why):</strong> Let's say in a few years you apply for a summer job or a special program. The company uses AI to sort through applications. Your application might get skipped. It could be that the AI was poorly designed to promote diversity and ended up accidentally filtering *out* male applicants for certain roles, or it might unfairly filter out female candidates for technical roles if it learned from historical data where mostly men held those positions.<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[21, 22]</a></sup> Or it might be looking for tiny, weird patterns in CVs that it *thinks* predict success, but actually have nothing to do with how good you'd be, accidentally discriminating against you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Misunderstandings & Shadow Bans:</strong> You post something online â€“ a joke, an opinion, a comment. An AI moderator, trained mostly on English internet drama or American cultural issues, might misunderstand your Norwegian slang, sarcasm, or cultural reference. It could flag your normal comment as "problematic," delete it, or even temporarily ban your account ("shadow ban" you so fewer people see your stuff) because it wrongly thinks you're breaking rules, even when you're just talking like a typical Norwegian teen. (Illustrative example based on principles from <sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[21, 22]</a></sup>)</li>

                    For your vocational field, a biased AI could lead to incorrect diagnoses, unfair assessments, or designs that don't suit everyone.

                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Sometimes AI models can generate information that is incorrect, misleading, or completely nonsensical, but present it as fact. This is called <span class="tooltip">AI hallucinations<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[24, 25]</a></sup><span class="tooltiptext">When AI invents facts or information that isn't true.</span></span>.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    <strong>Why does this happen?</strong> AI doesn't 'know' things like humans do. It's trained to predict the next most likely word (or pixel, or sound) based on the billions of examples it has seen.<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[2, 25]</a></sup> Think of it like a super-advanced autocomplete. If you ask it, 'Who will win the Ballon d'Or in 2025?', it doesn't know the answer. But it knows which football players' names often appear near 'Ballon d'Or winner'. So, it might confidently name a famous current player. It *sounds* believable because the name is right, the context is right, but the AI is just making a highly probable guess, not stating a known fact. It can be totally wrong.

                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    This isn't deliberate deception by the AI. It's just how it works: predicting patterns. If the patterns in its data are incomplete or lead to a 'likely' but false statement, it will still generate it.<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[25]</a></sup>

                <p class="content-text mb-4">
                    For example, an AI might 'invent' historical events or scientific 'facts.'<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[26]</a></sup> The problem is made worse because AI can make its output look very real and professional (what I, Daniel the teacher, like to call 'the look of expertise').<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[28, 29]</a></sup> Perfect grammar and a confident tone can make false information seem true, even when it's completely made up.

                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    When you use AI for school, the most important rule is: <span class="font-bold text-sky-600">You First!</span><sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[46, 47]</a></sup> This means you must always start by using your own brain â€“ your own thinking, planning, and initial effort â€“ *before* you turn to AI.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Think of it this way: using AI to write your essays or solve all your problems is like using a forklift to lift weights at the gym. Sure, the forklift can lift heavy things easily, but *you* don't get any stronger. The whole point of lifting weights is to build *your own* muscles. Similarly, the point of doing schoolwork isn't just to get an answer or a finished product; it's to build your "mental muscles."
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    When you write an essay, for example, you're not just learning to write. You're learning much deeper skills: how to structure your thoughts, organize complex information, think critically about a topic, find evidence, and communicate your ideas clearly and persuasively.<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[4]</a></sup> These are incredibly important skills for any job and for life in general. If AI does this heavy lifting for you, you miss out on developing these critical abilities.<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[48]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Learning can sometimes feel a bit tough or "painful" â€“ that's when your brain is really working hard and growing. It's often at these moments that it's most tempting to let AI take over. But remember the saying, "no pain, no gain." That struggle is actually what learning feels like. If you skip that struggle, you skip the learning.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Scientists have noticed that many teenagers today report feeling more stressed and perhaps less able to tackle difficulties. Some think this might be partly because technology, including AI, can remove many of the small challenges and hurdles that actually help us grow stronger and more resilient. Your brain is incredibly <span class="tooltip">plastic<span class="tooltiptext">Able to change and adapt as a result of experience.</span></span> (able to change and adapt) when you're young â€“ roughly until your early twenties.<sup class="citation"><a href="#references">[4]</a></sup> This is the prime time to build those fundamental thinking skills. If you rely too much on AI to do the thinking for you now, it can be much harder to develop these essential skills later in life.

                    <li><strong>Reduced Conduct Grade:</strong> Particularly blameworthy or gross single incidents of cheating can lead to a reduced conduct grade.
