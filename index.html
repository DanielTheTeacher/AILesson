    <!-- Application Structure Plan: 
        The SPA is structured with a fixed top navigation bar allowing users to jump to different thematic sections within the single page. This approach enhances usability by providing a clear overview and easy access to all content areas. The themes are derived from the report's modules but reorganized for a more intuitive user flow:
        1. Home: Introduction and overview.
        2. Explore AI: Covers the basics of AI, its presence in daily life, and relevance to vocational fields. Includes an interactive "AI Around Us". Gemini API added for field-specific insights. Illustrative chart removed.
        3. Think Critically: Addresses AI bias, hallucinations, misinformation, and filter bubbles. Features "Spot the AI Lie" and "Escape the Bubble" activities. Content simplified and made more relatable. "Burst the Bubble" exercise enhanced for more interaction.
        4. AI as Helper: Focuses on responsible AI use, the "You First" principle, augmentation vs. generation, ethical use cases, and academic integrity. Includes an interactive "Green/Yellow/Red Light" table. Gemini API added for project idea expansion.
        5. Your Future with AI: Explores AI's impact on jobs and highlights essential human skills. Includes "My Vocational Future with AI" input. Gemini API added for career outlook.
        6. AI & Society: Discusses data privacy, ethical dilemmas, and the student's role in shaping AI. Features ethical scenario discussions and a "Classroom AI Ethics Charter" activity.
        7. Exercises: A quick access point to key interactive elements from various sections.
        This thematic, non-linear structure is chosen over a direct module-by-module translation to make the content more engaging and allow students to explore topics based on interest, facilitating better understanding and retention for the target audience (VG1 vocational students). Key interactions include quizzes, reflective inputs, clickable reveals, and scenario analysis, now enhanced with LLM-powered features.

                <h3 class="subsection-title">What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h3>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Think of AI as computers or programs that can do things that usually require human intelligence. This can be learning from experience, solving problems, making decisions, or understanding language.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    An important part of AI is <span class="tooltip">Machine Learning (ML)<span class="tooltiptext">Systems that learn from large amounts of data to find patterns and make decisions without being specifically programmed for each task.</span></span>. For example, streaming services use ML to suggest movies you might like.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-4">
                    <span class="tooltip">Large Language Models (LLMs)<span class="tooltiptext">Advanced "computer brains" trained on enormous amounts of text and code.</span></span> are a type of AI you might have heard of, like ChatGPT. They learn patterns in language and can generate text, answer questions, and much more. Important: LLMs don't "think" like humans; they are good at predicting the next word based on patterns they've learned.

                    <p class="text-sm content-text">It's important to remember that AI, including LLMs, works by recognizing and copying patterns from its training data. They have no real understanding or consciousness. This is key to understanding both what AI can do, and what it *cannot* do.</p>

                    In most professions, AI is about <span class="tooltip">enhancing<span class="tooltiptext">Making better or stronger.</span></span> human skills, increasing efficiency and safety, not necessarily replacing people.

                <h3 class="subsection-title">How AI Learns (and Gets it Wrong): Bias In, Bias Out</h3>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    AI models learn by analyzing enormous amounts of data, often sourced from the internet. If this data contains <span class="tooltip">bias<span class="tooltiptext">Unfair leaning towards or against something or someone, often based on pre-existing ideas instead of facts.</span></span>, the AI will likely reflect and perhaps even <span class="tooltip">amplify<span class="tooltiptext">To make something stronger or louder, like turning up the volume.</span></span> these biases.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">Examples of AI bias that could affect you:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside content-text mb-2 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Wrong "Facts" Online (Even in Norwegian!):</strong> Imagine you're searching online for info – maybe about rules for something, or even a historical event. An AI-powered search engine might give you answers in perfect Norwegian and even say they're "Norwegian rules." But, because the AI was trained on way more data from, say, the USA, it might actually be giving you American rules or perspectives, just translated and dressed up as Norwegian. So you might end up learning or doing something completely wrong for Norway, even though the AI *sounded* like it knew what it was talking about for your country.</li>
                    <li><strong>Getting Skipped for an Opportunity (And No One Knows Why):</strong> Let's say in a few years you apply for a summer job or a special program. The company uses AI to sort through applications. Your application might get skipped, and neither you nor the company fully understands why. It could be that the AI was poorly designed to promote "diversity" and ended up accidentally filtering *out* male applicants for certain roles, even if that wasn't the goal. Or it might be looking for tiny, weird patterns in CVs that it *thinks* predict success, but actually have nothing to do with how good you'd be, accidentally discriminating against you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Misunderstandings & Shadow Bans:</strong> You post something online – a joke, an opinion, a comment. An AI moderator, trained mostly on English internet drama or American cultural issues, might misunderstand your Norwegian slang, sarcasm, or cultural reference. It could flag your normal comment as "problematic," delete it, or even temporarily ban your account ("shadow ban" you so fewer people see your stuff) because it wrongly thinks you're breaking rules, even when you're just talking like a typical Norwegian teen.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="content-text">
                    For your vocational field, a biased AI could lead to incorrect diagnoses, unfair assessments, or designs that don't suit everyone. It's important to remember that AI bias often mirrors existing <span class="tooltip">societal inequalities<span class="tooltiptext">Unfair differences in how groups of people are treated or have access to opportunities in society.</span></span>. Therefore, human oversight and critical assessment are always needed.

                <h3 class="subsection-title">AI "Hallucinations" & **Looks Real, But Isn't**: Spotting Convincing Fakes</h3>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    Sometimes AI models can generate information that is incorrect, misleading, or completely nonsensical, but present it as fact. This is called <span class="tooltip">AI hallucinations<span class="tooltiptext">When AI invents facts or information that isn't true.</span></span>.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    <strong>Why does this happen?</strong> AI doesn't 'know' things like humans do. It's trained to predict the next most likely word (or pixel, or sound) based on the billions of examples it has seen. Think of it like a super-advanced autocomplete. If you ask it, 'Who will win the Ballon d'Or in 2025?', it doesn't know the future. But it knows which football players' names often appear near 'Ballon d'Or winner'. So, it might confidently name a famous current player. It *sounds* believable because the name is right, the context is right, but the AI is just making a highly probable guess, not stating a known fact. It can be totally wrong.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-2">
                    This isn't deliberate deception by the AI. It's just how it works: predicting patterns. If the patterns in its data are incomplete or lead to a 'likely' but false statement, it will still generate it.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text mb-4">
                    For example, an AI might 'invent' historical events or scientific 'facts.' The problem is made worse because AI can make its output look very real and professional (what I, Daniel the teacher, like to call 'the look of expertise'). Perfect grammar and a confident tone can make false information seem true, even when it's completely made up.

                    On the internet, false or inaccurate information can spread quickly. It's important to distinguish between:

                    AI can amplify these problems. Algorithms on social media can create:

                    <strong>The Dangers are Real:</strong> This isn't just about being wrong; it's serious. Believing and spreading false AI-generated information can have severe consequences. In your future jobs, decisions based on bad info could lead to dangerous mistakes, financial loss, or harm to people's reputations or even their safety. Imagine an electrician relying on faulty AI-generated wiring diagrams, or a healthcare assistant acting on incorrect AI medical advice. Online, it can lead to bullying, scams, and even influence important societal events like elections with false narratives. Being critical isn't just a skill; it's a responsibility to protect yourself and others.

                    <li><strong>Building and Construction:</strong> Drones with AI to monitor construction sites, AI to optimize designs for energy efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sales, Service, and Tourism:</strong> AI chatbots for customer service, personalized recommendations for travel and products.</li>
